The attribute database carried 100 million data changes per day and 1000 data recalls with a delay of only 15ms, saving nearly 50% in costs. Developed functions for task management and feature generation for the Feature Factory platform using SpringBoot, which processes mass user operation data to generate behavior feature data. The data was used for recommendation model training, resulting in saving more than 10 times the calculation cost and improving the News Feed CTR by 3% in mobile browsers. Participated in search query subtopic mining, a collaborative project with Renmin University of China. This project aimed to enhance users\u0026rsquo; search interest and help them accurately locate search needs by building a query sub-topic mining system using information from query webpages, user logs, Wikipedia, and a knowledge graph. This project is set to be granted a patent within the next three months. Honors \u0026amp; Awards Future Star Award by Huawei Technologies Co.
